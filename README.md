# CYK-algorithm-for-CFG
Implementation of the Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm for context-free-grammars, which I completed for a Natural Language Processing course.

The Symbol, Rule, and PCFG (sub)-classes were given as part of the assignment

See the Pseudocode for the algorith (Jurafsky d. & Martin j. h. speech and language processing (3rd ed.), Ch 17, (2019))
